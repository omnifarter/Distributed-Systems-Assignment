# 50.041 Distributed Systems Assignment

## Introduction
This repository contains all of my solutions to the various assignments. In total, there will be 3 Problem sets throughout the course. All problem sets are completed using GO. The CLI interface is a library from promptUI.

## Usage
At the directory root, run `go run main.go` to run the CLI interface. Alternatively, you can also build an executable with `go build main.go`. Follow the prompts in the CLI to run the simulation.

The simulation is also ran in an indefinite loop. Once the logs have been printed long enough for assessment, the program must be stopped (Ctrl + C).

## Code structure
Navigate to the part's file to view the source code of the simulation. For example, Problem set 1's part 1.1 (Client Server Architecture) is located at `/Pset/Pset1/Part1/Part1.1.go`. There is no shared code for ease of marking. I have left comments in each file detailing my approach to the problem as well.
